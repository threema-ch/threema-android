        The first call without the challenge response properties initiates the
        challenge request. The second call must repeat the exact same properties
        and the challenge response.

        When receiving this request without the challenge response:

        1. If the request could not be decoded, respond with status code `400`.
        2. Respond with an authentication challenge tied to the provided data
           with purpose _delete_.

        When receiving this request with the challenge response:

        1. If the request could not be decoded, respond with status code `400`.
        2. If the Work `credentials` are invalid, respond with status code `401`
           and code `invalid-credentials`.
        3. If the `challenge` expired, respond with status code `401` and code
           `challenge-expired`.
        4. If the `challenge` is not tied to the provided data or does not have
           the purpose _delete_, respond with status code `401` and code
           `invalid-challenge-response`.
        5. If the `response` is not the correctly _signed_ `challenge`, respond
           with status code `401` and code `invalid-challenge-response`.
        6. Remove any existing Remote Secret entry tied to `identity` and
           `remoteSecretAuthenticationToken`.
        7. Respond with status code `204`.

        When receiving this request:

        1. Look up a Remote Secret tied to `identity` and

        2. If `secret` is not defined, respond with status code `404`.
        3. If the access to `secret` is blocked, respond with status code `403`.
        4. Respond with status code `200` and `secret` along with the associated
           configuration for `identity`.
