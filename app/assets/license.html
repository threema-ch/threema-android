<p>curve25519-donna: Curve25519 elliptic curve, public key function</p>

<p>http://code.google.com/p/curve25519-donna/</p>

<p>Adam Langley agl@imperialviolet.org</p>

<p>Derived from public domain C code by Daniel J. Bernstein djb@cr.yp.to</p>

<p>More information about curve25519 can be found here http://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html</p>

<p>djb's sample implementation of curve25519 is written in a special assembly language called qhasm
    and uses the floating point registers.</p>

<p>This is, almost, a clean room reimplementation from the curve25519 paper. It uses many of the
    tricks described therein. Only the crecip function is taken from the sample implementation.</p>

            appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only
            and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices
            within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to
            the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
            provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
            reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such

    terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor
    regarding such Contributions.</p>

    redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise
    of permissions under this License.</p>

<p><strong><a name="no-liability">8. Limitation of Liability</a></strong>. In no event and

    otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
    grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result
    of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including

    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
    obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
    obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility,

    or additional liability.</p>
